# trello-2.5

## Summary

This project was originially built by Joseph Lieu, Nicholas Lopez, and myself. As a challenge I wanted to update and deploy this project within the Next.js framework.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
