# Trello 2.5
Trello 2.5 is a clone of the kanban-style site Trello® used for project and task management. Create boards, lists, and cards to organize daily tasks or projects.


## 🏆 Goals

My goal in this project was to get aquainted with the full-stack capabilities of Next.js and to learn how to use Tanstack Query. I wanted to retain the features of Trello 2 while improving the UI/UX, drag-and-drop functionality, and adding new features such as labels and descriptions in the cards.

## 🔑 Features

- **Secure Authentication:** Google OAuth authentication via NextAuth and guest authentication for users to test the application.
- **Drag and Drop Functionality:** Lists and cards can be dragged seamlessly powered by Framer Motion Reorder.
- **Sleek, Responsive, Modern Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, and animations from Framer Motion.
- **React Query:** Handles server state management and provides visual feedback when creating or deleting boards, lists, and cards through optimistic UI updates.

## Inspiration

My idea for this project came from Trello 2, a team based project built during my time at Parsity. Trello 2 was developed using Redux, React with Create React App, Node, Express, and had a JWT-based authentication strategy. Feel Free to view that project repo [here](https://github.com/bcsurf2822/ParsityTrello).
