# Trello 2.5

Trello 2.5 is an enhanced clone of the popular Trello platform, rebuilt from the ground up as an update to my original Trello 2 project, which was developed during my time at Parsity. This updated version was built using Next.js' full-stack capabilities, integrates Google OAuth via NextAuth, includes a guest login option, leverages TanStack Query for efficient server state management, features a cleaner, more modern UI/UX, and uses MongoDB Atlas to securely store and manage data.

The original Trello 2 project was built using legacy Redux, Create React App, and had a JWT-based authentication strategy. Feel Free to view that project [here](https://github.com/bcsurf2822/ParsityTrello).

## Features

- Log in securely with Google OAuth authentication via NextAuth.
- Access the application instantly with a Guest Login option.
- Drag and drop Lists seamlessly using Framer Motion Reorder for dynamic reordering.
- Create boards, lists, and cards to organize tasks effectively.
